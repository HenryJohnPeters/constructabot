The /cout-ai/cout-ai/prisma/migrations directory is intended to contain migration files generated by Prisma. Since this is a directory and not a file, it does not contain any specific content. Therefore, the contents of this directory will be generated when you run the Prisma migration commands.

For now, this directory is intentionally left blank.
